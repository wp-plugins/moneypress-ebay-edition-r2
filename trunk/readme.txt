This plugin allows you to display eBay listings on your web site by placing a simple shortcode in your page or post. Filter results by keyword, seller ID, or a combination of both.

== Description ==

Our MoneyPress : eBay Edition plugin allows you to easily display products from eBay based on keywords you provide. It makes it simple to show product listings for anything relevant to your site. All product entries also come with images, current asking prices, and links to eBay to get further information about the product.

List your own products by entering your seller ID, or sell any product on eBay and earn a commission with your eBay Partner ID or other approved affiliate program ID. If you are an eBay seller or an approved eBay affiliate this plugin will help boost the income earning potential of your site in just a few easy steps.

After installing the plugin (see below for instructions) you can show products on any page on your site by using the ‘[ebay_show_items]’ shortcode.  For example, entering the shortcode

    [mp_ebay keywords="wordpress books"]

would populate your site with a listing of products matching those keywords.  You can put any keywords you like into the shortcode, to best suit your website.

If you are a merchant on eBay then you can enter your seller ID to list only your own products.  Or you could put it anyone’s seller ID, if you want to list their products.  If you have entered a seller ID then you do not have to provide any keywords.  For example, you could just write

    [mp_ebay]

on one of your pages to list everything you are selling on eBay.
